                        <p>Acquaintance with JollyHeap cubes starts with experiments (touching, rolling, throwing, etc.) Afterwards they are used to build different structures and serve as material to create role-playing games.</p>
                        <p>Constructing - is the most important type of activity in early childhood and primary school. It is important for construction toys to give an opportunity for maximum expression of children’s imagination and to encourage exploring, experimentation and learning. A big amount of colorful blocks stimulates to play in all kinds of social roles and situations, while enjoying in group or individually.</p>

                        <p>With the help of JollyHeap toy, the child learns: color, shape, magnetism, logical connection between blocks.</p>
                        <p>During the game with magnetic construction toy, children not only create a variety of shapes and 2- or 3-dimensional structures, but also develop motor-visual skills, attention, accuracy and associative thinking, learn foundations of physics. To create some difficult structures they need to work in groups, this helps to build relationships with coevals.</p>

In addition, they also teach them to be more creative. Playing with our toy gives a lot of benefits: exercises visual - motor coordination, teaches shape recognition and foundations of physics, develops concentration, accuracy, logical thinking, helps in building relationships with coevals and in training flexibility and sportiness. Only advantages!
